This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
with some additional configurations like ESlint, Prettier, lint-staged, husky
and basic folders structure. I am using it as a boilerplate of my Next.js
projects so I don't have to configure everything from the ground up.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
